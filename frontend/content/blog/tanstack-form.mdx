<TableContent title="Tanstack Form with Next.JS App Router" />

Forms are the most important part of any web application. It is used to collect data from the user. It can be tricky to handle form with good validation, accessibility and custom styling. Providing good user experience is the most important part of any web application. You don't want to let user fill the form again and again.

[Tanstack Form](https://tanstack.com/form/latest/docs/overview) is a best tool for handling form in our React Apps which provides Reactive, Complex validation, Accessibility and custom styling. Which help to build a better and robust form in our Apps. It works with **React Server Component** out of the box and Support for Typescript make it end to end type safe.

<SubHeadings>Tanstack From</SubHeadings>

- **Reactive :** Tanstack Form is reactive in nature. It means that the form will update automatically when the state of the form changes. It uses the concept of observables to achieve this.
- **Complex validation :** Tanstack Form provides a easy way to validate the form. we can use the own custom validation logic or use the built-in supported validators like zod, yup, valibot etc.
- **Bundle size :** Tanstack Form is very lightweight. It is only 6.1kb. Compared to React Hook Form which is 10.1kb and Formik which is 13.2kb.
- **Type safe :** Tanstack Form is fully type safe. It provides full type safety with Typescript. It even infer the type of nested objects and arrays quite well.

## Installation

We are going to use Tanstack Form with Next.JS latest version where we will explore how we can use Tanstack Form with Next.JS App Router using server action.

> I assume you have already created a Next.JS App and you are familiar with Next.JS App Router.

```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-form zod @tanstack/zod-form-adapter
```

We will use **zod** as a validation library. You can use any other validation library like **yup**, **valibot** etc which are supported by Tanstack Form.

## Tanstack form setup

We have to structure our form in a way that it can work with server component and we can use server action.

<SubHeadings> Form Schema </SubHeadings>

Tanstack Form provides `formOptions` function which let us create default values which we can share to client and server actions both places. We can create form schema and validation for server using `createServerValidate`.

```tsx
// form-factory.tsx

import { createServerValidate, formOptions } from '@tanstack/react-form/nextjs';

export const formOpts = formOptions({
  defaultValues: {
    firstName: '',
    age: 0,
  },
});

export const serverValidate = createServerValidate({
  ...formOpts,
  onServerValidate({ value }) {
    if (value.age < 12) {
      return 'age | You must be at least 12 to sign up';
    }

    if (value.firstName === '') {
      return 'firstName | FirstName is required';
    }
  },
});
```

Here we have created a form schema with default values and validation logic. We are using `onServerValidate` function to validate the form on server side. We are returning the error message if the validation fails.

> You can use **ZOD** to validte data instead for manually checking the validation.

<Separator />

<SubHeadings> Server Action </SubHeadings>

We need to create a server action which will be used to validate the form on server side and do the server side action like saving the form data to database etc.

```tsx
// action.ts

'use server';

import { ServerValidateError } from '@tanstack/react-form/nextjs';
import { formOpts, serverValidate } from './form-factory';

const initialState = formOpts?.defaultValues!;
export type TResult = typeof initialState;

const getFormData = (formData: FormData) => {
  const result = {} as TResult;

  formData.forEach((data, key) => {
    if (key.includes('$ACTION')) return;
    (result as any)[key] = data;
  });
  return result;
};

const formAction = async (prev: unknown, formData: FormData) => {
  try {
    await serverValidate(formData);

    const data = getFormData(formData);
    // Do something with the data
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof ServerValidateError) {
      return error.formState;
    }
    throw error;
  }

  return formOpts?.defaultValues;
};

export default formAction;
```

Here witch `formAction` function we are validating the form data and doing the server side action. We are using `serverValidate` function to validate the form data.

We are extracting the form data from `formData` as formData contains some extra data which we don't need. We are using `getFormData` function to extract the form data.

<SubHeadings> Form Component </SubHeadings>

With the above setup we are ready to use Tanstack Form with server action. Now we need to create a form component which will be used to render the form.

```tsx
// form.tsx

'use client';

import {
  FormApi,
  mergeForm,
  useForm,
  useTransform,
  ValidationError,
} from '@tanstack/react-form';
import action, { TResult } from './action';
import { useFormState } from 'react-dom';
import ButtonStatus from './button-status';
import { zodValidator } from '@tanstack/zod-form-adapter';
import { z } from 'zod';
import { formOpts } from './form-factory';
import { initialFormState } from '@tanstack/react-form/nextjs';

const Form = () => {
  const [state, setAction] = useFormState(action, initialFormState);

  // form instance
  const { useStore, Subscribe, handleSubmit, Field } = useForm({
    ...formOpts,
    transform: useTransform(
      (baseForm: FormApi<any, any>) => mergeForm(baseForm, state),
      [state]
    ),
  });

  // server side errors
  const formErrors = useStore((formState) => formState.errors);

  // we are extracting the server side errors from formErrors
  const serverErrors = formErrors.reduce((acc, curr) => {
    if (!curr) return acc;
    const [key, value] = curr.split(' | ');
    const result = { ...acc, [key]: value };
    return result;
  }, {} as TResult);

  return (
    <section className="flex h-screen w-full flex-col items-center justify-center">
      <form action={setAction as never} onSubmit={() => handleSubmit()}>
        <div>
          <Field name="age">
            {(field) => {
              return (
                <>
                  <input
                    name="age"
                    id="age"
                    type="number"
                    value={field.state.value || ''}
                    onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.valueAsNumber)}
                  />
                  <ErrorText error={field.state.meta.errors}>
                    {serverErrors?.age}
                  </ErrorText>
                </>
              );
            }}
          </Field>

          <Field name="firstName">
            {(field) => {
              return (
                <>
                  <input
                    name="firstName"
                    type="text"
                    id="firstName"
                    value={field.state.value || ''}
                    onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
                  />
                  <ErrorText error={field.state.meta.errors}>
                    {serverErrors?.firstName}
                  </ErrorText>
                </>
              );
            }}
          </Field>
        </div>

        <Subscribe selector={(formState) => [formState.canSubmit]}>
          {([canSubmit]) => <ButtonStatus canSubmit={canSubmit} />}
        </Subscribe>
      </form>
    </section>
  );
};

export default Form;

// ErrorText.tsx
const ErrorText = ({
  children,
  error,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  error: ValidationError[];
}) => {
  return (
    <>
      {error.map((error) => (
        <p key={error as string}>{error}</p>
      ))}
      {error.length === 0 && <p>{children}</p>}
    </>
  );
};
```

Let's break down the above code:

<Summary>
  <LI>
    `useActionState` is hook provided by React which lets us work with server
    actions forms. It allows us to update state based on the result of a form
    action.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    We are using `useForm` hook to get the form instance. where we are passing
    our default values and using `useTransform` function to merge the form state
    with the server state.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    We are extracting the server side errors from `formErrors` and showing them
    in the form. If you remember we are passing error from server in a form that
    later we can transform it in key value pair and use it.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    We are rendering our form and there is no client side validation yet.
    `action` let us use server action and `onSubmit` for client side interaction
    with form to show state based on event and validation.
  </LI>
  <LI>
    `ErrorText` Component is where we are showing error for **client** and
    **server** both. In the form of children we are passing the server error and
    in prop the client one.
  </LI>
</Summary>

You see we are using `ButtonStatus` component which let's us know the current state of form.

```tsx
import { useFormStatus } from 'react-dom';

const ButtonStatus = ({ canSubmit }: { canSubmit: boolean }) => {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus();
  return (
    <button type="submit" disabled={!canSubmit}>
      {pending ? 'Loading...' : 'Submit'}
    </button>
  );
};

export default ButtonStatus;
```

You must be thinking why we created a different component as we can hove use in the same component right?

Well to work `useFormStatus` we must need to use in a component which will be rendered inside the form. and its provides state for parent form. Like here we are using `pending` and its provides few other state too you can check [here](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/hooks/useFormStatus)

## Client side validation using ZOD

Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. I like zod because it is very easy to use and provides a lot of features an widely used in the community, Which make it easy to find the solution if you face any issue.

```tsx
'use client';

// ...rest of the imports
import { zodValidator } from '@tanstack/zod-form-adapter';
import { z } from 'zod';

const Form = () => {
  // ... rest of the code
  return (
    <section>
      <form action={setAction as never} onSubmit={() => handleSubmit()}>
        <div>
          <Field
            name="age"
            validatorAdapter={zodValidator()}
            validators={{
              onChange: (value) => {
                if (Number.isNaN(value.value)) return false;
                const schema = z.number().min(9);
                const res = schema.safeParse(value.value);
                if (res.success) return false;
                return 'You must be at least 8 to sign up';
              },
            }}
          >
            {(field) => {
              return (
                <>
                  <input
                    name="age"
                    type="number"
                    value={field.state.value || ''}
                    onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.valueAsNumber)}
                  />
                </>
              );
            }}
          </Field>

          <Field
            name="firstName"
            validatorAdapter={zodValidator()}
            validators={{
              onChange: z.string().min(1, 'FirstName is required'),
            }}
          >
            {(field) => {
              return (
                <>
                  <input
                    name="firstName"
                    type="text"
                    value={field.state.value || ''}
                    onChange={(e) => field.handleChange(e.target.value)}
                  />
                </>
              );
            }}
          </Field>
        </div>
        ... rest of the code
      </form>
    </section>
  );
};

export default Form;
```

Here we are using `zodValidator` which is provided by `@tanstack/zod-form-adapter`. We are using `zod` to validate the form on client side. We are using `validators` prop to validate the form fields. We are using `onChange` validator to validate the form fields on change.

You can write any custom validation logic in the `validators` prop. It just you have return support error types like string, boolean, null etc.

## Conclusion

Tanstack Form is a best tool for handling form in our React Apps and with the rise of RSC(React Server Components), We want to use server action which make life easy to handle form on server side. The end to end type safe with Typescript make it more reliable and easy to use.

The flexibility and control it provides to the developer is amazing. We always want to build a better and robust form in our Apps which provide good user experience. There are many other things to learn which you can explore in the [official documentation](https://tanstack.com/form/latest/docs/overview).
