## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool that helps you to deploy your application to the cloud. It is an open-source platform that was developed by Google. It is a portable, extensible, and open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

<SubHeadings>The Advantages of Kubernetes are as Follows</SubHeadings>

- **Portable** :- Kubernetes is portable, which means that you can deploy it on any cloud platform, likes of AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.

- **Extensible** :- Kubernetes is extensible, which means that you can add more features to it.

- **Self-healing** :- Kubernetes is self-healing, which means that if any of your containers fails, then Kubernetes will restart it.

- **Automated rollouts and rollbacks** :- Kubernetes supports automated rollouts and rollbacks, which means that if you want to deploy a new version of your application, then Kubernetes will first deploy it on a small number of containers, and if it works fine, then it will deploy it on all the containers. If it doesn't work fine, then it will rollback to the previous version.

- **Horizontal scaling** :- Kubernetes supports horizontal scaling, which means that if your application is getting more traffic, then Kubernetes will automatically scale it horizontally by adding more containers.

- **Service discovery and load balancing** :- Kubernetes supports service discovery and load balancing, which means that if you have multiple containers of your application, then Kubernetes will automatically load balance the traffic between them.

There are many other advantages of Kubernetes, but these are the main ones. and in this article, we will learn how to deploy a Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB application to Kubernetes.

<SubHeadings>Prerequisites</SubHeadings>

- Setup Project your locally from [here](https://github.com/Virous77/dockerize-fullstack-app/tree/main)
- Docker installed on your machine
- Minikube installed on your machine

## Setting up Minikube

[Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a Virtual Machine (VM) on your laptop for users looking to try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day.

### Installing Minikube

**MacOS**

```bash
brew install minikube
```

**Windows**

```bash
winget install minikube
```

**Linux**

```bash
# x86-64

curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube

# ARM64

curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-arm64
sudo install minikube-linux-arm64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
```

### Minikube Commands

We will use Docker as driver for Minikube as it is the most stable one and easy to start. so make sure your Docker is running.

```bash
# start
minikube start

# stop
minikube stop

# dashboard
minikube dashboard

```

For more information on Minikube, you can visit [here](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/). here you can find more information on how to install Minikube on different platforms.

## Installing Kubectl

Kubectl is a command-line tool that is used to deploy and manage applications on Kubernetes. It is used to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs.

Visit [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) to install Kubectl on different platforms.

After installing Kubectl, Make sure you have started your Minikube.

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

If you get the following output, then it means that you have successfully installed Kubectl.

```bash
# No resources found in default namespace.
```

## Setting up our App configuration

We are using same app which we have dockerized in our pervious article for development. Rename the existing Dockerfile to **Dockerfile.dev** and Create a new file called **Dockerfile** in the frontend directory and add the following code to it.

```docker
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm i

COPY . /app

# we have just added this line to build our app
RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 3000

CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

**Updating our ENV variables**

```bash

# For frontend

NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=http://backend-app-service:4000

# For backend

PORT=4000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo-service:27017/dockerize-backend
```

I will explain later why we have changed the URL since our app is running on localhost.

### Building Docker Images

Make sure you are in the root directory of the project.

```bash

# For frontend

docker build -t full-frontend .

# For backend

docker build -t full-backend .
```

### Creating YAML files for Kubernetes

Make sure you are in the root directory of the project. out of frontend and backend directory. Create a new file called `Deployment.yaml` and add the following code to it.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: frontend-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: frontend-app
          image: full-frontend:latest
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          envFrom:
            - configMapRef:
                name: frontend-app-config

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: backend-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: backend
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: backend-app
          image: full-backend:latest
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          envFrom:
            - configMapRef:
                name: backend-app-config

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mongo
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mongo
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: mongo
          image: mongo
```

explanation:

- `apiVersion`: It is the version of the Kubernetes API that we are using.
- `kind`: Kubernetes need know which type of resource that we are creating. so in our case, we are creating a deployment.
- `metadata`: It is the metadata of our deployment.
- `spec` : It is the specification of our deployment. It contains the number of replicas, selector, and template. The number of replicas is the number of pods that we want to create. The selector is used to select the pods that we want to create. The template is used to create the pods. It contains the labels and containers. The labels are used to select the pods. The containers are used to create the containers. It contains the name of the container, image, and environment variables.

### YAML file for Service

Create a new file called `Service.yaml` and add the following code to it.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: frontend-app-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: frontend
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3000
      targetPort: 3000

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: backend-app-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: backend
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 4000
      targetPort: 4000

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mongo-service
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: mongo
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 27017
      targetPort: 27017
```

As you can see, we have created three services. The type of the first two services is LoadBalancer, and the type of the third service is ClusterIP. The type LoadBalancer is used to expose our app to the outside world, and the type ClusterIP is used to expose our app to the inside world.

Thats why we have changed the URL in our ENV variables. since kubernetes will create a DNS for our services. so we can access our app by using the service name.

### YAML file for ConfigMap

Create a new file called `ConfigMap.yaml` and add the following code to it.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: frontend-app-config
data:
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL: http://backend-app-service:4000
  DEBUG: 'true'

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: backend-app-config
data:
  MONGO_URI: mongodb://mongo-service:27017/dockerize-backend
  PORT: '4000'
  DEBUG: 'true'
```

## Adding our images to Minikube

Make sure you have started your Minikube.

```bash
# For frontend

minikube image load full-frontend:latest

# For backend

minikube image load full-backend:latest
```

You can check your images by running the following command.

```bash
minikube image list

# or

eval $(minikube docker-env)
docker images
```

<Separator />

## Starting our App

Make sure you are in the root directory of the project.

```bash
kubectl apply -f .

# or

kubectl apply -f Deployment.yaml -f Service.yaml -f ConfigMap.yaml
```

It will start our app. You can check the status of your pods by running the following command.

```bash

# For pods
kubectl get pods

# For services
kubectl get services
```

### Accessing our app

Minikube provides a command to access our app. since we have added the type as LoadBalancer in our service, so we can access our app by running the following command in two different terminals tab.

```bash
minikube service frontend-app-service
minikube service backend-app-service
```

It will open our app in the browser. Else you can open your app on provided IP from `minikube` after running `minikube server ...` command.

### Access Kubernetes Dashboard

```bash
minikube dashboard
```

There you can see all the pods, services, and deployments. and you can also see the logs of your pods.

### Shutting down our app

```bash
kubectl delete -f .

# or

kubectl delete -f Deployment.yaml -f Service.yaml -f ConfigMap.yaml
```

> You can rebuild you images if you do changes in app with same name and load to minikube and then apply the changes.

### Conclusion

Kubernetes make it easy to deploy our app to the cloud. It is a very powerful tool. There is a lot more to learn about Kubernetes. I will share new article where we will learn how to presist our data in Kubernetes and using `nginx` as reverse proxy.

I hope you liked this article. You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/Virous77/dockerize-fullstack-app/tree/kubernetes-setup), checkout to `kubernetes-setup` branch. If you have any questions, then please let me know in the comments.
