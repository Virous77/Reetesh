A decentralized application (DApp) is a type of software application that operates on a decentralized network rather than being controlled by a single entity or authority. Unlike traditional applications that rely on central servers, DApps leverage blockchain technology to ensure decentralization, transparency, and immutability.

DApps are built on top of blockchain platforms like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. Ethereum is the most popular blockchain platform for building DApps.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to build a DApp using React and Solidity on Ethereum. We will also learn how to deploy the DApp on the Ethereum blockchain and interact with it using Metamask.

### Setting up the Remix IDE

Remix IDE is an online IDE that allows you to write, compile, and deploy smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a great tool for beginners to get started with smart contract development. Since it has everything you need to get started with smart contract development, you don't need to install anything on your computer.

To get started, head over to the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and create a new project. You will see a screen like this :

Delete the default contract files and create a new contract called `Storage.sol`. We will use this contract to store and retrieve number from the Ethereum blockchain.

### Writing the Smart Contract

Let's write a simple smart contract that will allow us to store and retrieve number from the Ethereum blockchain.

```solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.22;

contract Storage {
    uint public data;

    constructor(){
        data = 0;
    }

    function setData(uint _data) public {
        data = data + _data;
    }

    function getData() public view returns (uint) {
        return data;
    }
}
```

The `Storage` contract has two functions: `setData` and `getData`. The `setData` function allows us to store a number on the blockchain, and the `getData` function allows us to retrieve the number from the blockchain.

### Deploying the Smart Contract

Now that we have written the smart contract, let's deploy it on the Ethereum blockchain. To deploy the smart contract, click on the `Deploy & run transactions` icon on the left sidebar.

> 1. On the Top you can see `Environment` dropdown, select `Injected provider - metamask` from the dropdown. This will allow you to interact with the smart contract using Metamask.

> 2. Make sure you have Metamask installed on your browser and you are connected to the `Sepolia Test Network`.

> 3. You can get free test ETH from [here](https://sepoliafaucet.com/).

Now that everything is set up, click on the `Deploy` button to deploy the smart contract.

Once the smart contract is deployed, you will get the address of the smart contract. Copy the address and save it somewhere as we will need it later.

We need to copy the ABI (Application Binary Interface) of the smart contract as well. To copy the ABI, click on `solidity compiler` icon on the left sidebar and click on the `ABI` and copy and store it.

## Building the Frontend

We will use [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) to set up the React app. To get started, run the following command :

```bash
npx create-react-app dapp
```

Once the React app is created, navigate to the project directory and install the following dependencies:

```bash
cd dapp
npm install web3 @metamask/sdk-react react-hot-toast
```

### Setting up Metamask SDK

Create a `utils` folder in the `src` directory and create a file called `MetamaskProvider.jsx` inside the `utils` folder. We will use this file to initialize the Metamask SDK.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { MetaMaskProvider } from "@metamask/sdk-react";
import icon from "../assets/logo192.png";

const MetamaskProvider = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <MetaMaskProvider
        debug={true}
        sdkOptions={{
          dappMetadata: {
            name: "Storage App",
            url: window.location.host,
            iconUrl: icon, // optional
          },
        }}
      >
        {children};
      </MetaMaskProvider>
    </>
  );
};

export default MetamaskProvider;
```

Now that we have initialized the Metamask SDK, let's wrap the `Index` component with the `MetamaskProvider` component. `Index` component is the entry point of the React app.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";
import MetamaskProvider from "./utils/MetamaskProvider";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <MetamaskProvider>
      <App />
    </MetamaskProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

### Setting up Contract Instance

Within the `utils` folder, create a file called `constant.js`. We will use this file to initialize the contract instance.

We will add our contract address and ABI in this file.

```javascript
export const address = "0x47472ae8413b98F645742884341CD88e9D10D6B6";

export const abi = [
  {
    inputs: [
      {
        internalType: "uint256",
        name: "_data",
        type: "uint256",
      },
    ],
    name: "setData",
    outputs: [],
    stateMutability: "nonpayable",
    type: "function",
  },
  {
    inputs: [],
    stateMutability: "nonpayable",
    type: "constructor",
  },
  {
    inputs: [],
    name: "data",
    outputs: [
      {
        internalType: "uint256",
        name: "",
        type: "uint256",
      },
    ],
    stateMutability: "view",
    type: "function",
  },
  {
    inputs: [],
    name: "getData",
    outputs: [
      {
        internalType: "uint256",
        name: "",
        type: "uint256",
      },
    ],
    stateMutability: "view",
    type: "function",
  },
];
```

To initialize the contract instance, we will setup a `Context` with following code :

```javascript
import { createContext, useState, useContext, useEffect } from "react";
import { useSDK } from "@metamask/sdk-react";
import Web3 from "web3";
import { abi, address } from "../utils/constant";

const contextState = {
  account: "",
  connectToMetaMask: () => {},
  connected: false,
  connecting: false,
  provider: {},
  sdk: {},
  web3: {},
};

const AppContext = createContext(contextState);

export const AppContextProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [account, setAccount] = useState("");
  const { sdk, connected, connecting, provider } = useSDK();

  const connectToMetaMask = async () => {
    try {
      const accounts = await sdk?.connect();
      setAccount(accounts?.[0]);
    } catch (err) {
      console.warn(`failed to connect..`, err);
    }
  };

  const app = new Web3(provider);
  const web3 = new app.eth.Contract(abi, address);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!account) {
      connectToMetaMask();
    }
  }, [connected]);

  return (
    <AppContext.Provider
      value={{
        account,
        connectToMetaMask,
        connected,
        connecting,
        provider,
        sdk,
        web3,
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </AppContext.Provider>
  );
};

export const useAppContext = () => useContext(AppContext);
export default AppContext;
```

Explanation:

- We are using the `useSDK` hook from the `@metamask/sdk-react` package to initialize the Metamask SDK. Which will allow us to interact with the Metamask wallet.
- We are using the [Web3](https://web3js.org/?ref=blog.chainsafe.io) package to initialize the contract instance. We are passing the `provider` to the `Web3` instance. The `provider` is provided by the Metamask SDK. The `provider` allows us to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- We are passing our `ABI` and `contract address` to the `Web3` instance to initialize the contract instance.

Now that we have initialized the contract instance, let's wrap the `App` component with the `AppContextProvider` component. as we wrapped the `Index` component with the `MetamaskProvider` component.

### Building the UI

Now that we have set up the React app, let's build the UI. We will create a `components` folder in the `src` directory and create a file called `Home.jsx` inside the `components` folder.

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";
import styles from "./home.module.css";
import { useAppContext } from "../contexts/AppContext";
import toast from "react-hot-toast";

const Home = () => {
  const { web3, account, connectToMetaMask, connected, connecting } =
    useAppContext();
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState("idle");
  const [number, setNumber] = useState("");

  const getNumber = async (e) => {
    try {
      setIsLoading("fetching");
      const number = await web3.methods.getData().call();
      setIsLoading("idle");
      setNumber(number);
    } catch (error) {
      setIsLoading("idle");
      toast.error("Error in fetching fleet");
    }
  };

  const handleAddNumber = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (inputRef.current.value === "") {
      return;
    }

    try {
      setIsLoading("adding");
      if (!account) {
        toast.error("Please connect to your wallet");
        setIsLoading("idle");
        return;
      }

      await web3.methods
        .setData(inputRef.current.value)
        .send({
          from: account,
          gas: 3000000,
        })
        .on("receipt", () => {
          inputRef.current.value = "";
          getNumber();
          toast.success("Number added successfully");
          setIsLoading("idle");
        })
        .on("error", () => {
          throw new Error("Error in adding number");
        });
    } catch (error) {
      toast.error("Error in adding number");
      setIsLoading("idle");
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    if (connected) {
      getNumber();
    }
  }, [connected]);

  return (
    <section className={styles.home}>
      <div className={styles.wallet}>
        {!connected && (
          <button onClick={connectToMetaMask}>
            {connecting ? "Connecting..." : "Connect to MetaMask"}
          </button>
        )}
      </div>
      <div className={styles.number}>
        {isLoading === "fetching" ? (
          <p>Fetching number...</p>
        ) : (
          <p>
            Number: <span>{number.toString()}</span>
          </p>
        )}
      </div>
      <div className={styles.form}>
        <form onSubmit={handleAddNumber}>
          <input
            type="number"
            placeholder="Enter number"
            ref={inputRef}
            disabled={!connected}
          />
          <button type="submit" disabled={!connected || isLoading === "adding"}>
            {isLoading === "adding" ? "Adding..." : "Add Number"}
          </button>
        </form>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

As you can see, we have created a simple UI that allows us to add and retrieve the number from the blockchain.

I have created two functions: `getNumber` and `handleAddNumber`. The `getNumber` function allows us to retrieve the number from the blockchain, and the `handleAddNumber` function allows us to add the number to the blockchain.

> Note: To Learn more about **Web3**, check out the [official documentation](https://docs.web3js.org/libdocs/Contract).

Now that we have created the UI, let's add the `Home` component to the `App` component.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { Toaster } from "react-hot-toast";
import Home from "./components/Home";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <main className="main">
      <Home />
      <Toaster />
    </main>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Now that we have added the `Home` component to the `App` component, let's run the app and see if everything is working fine.

To run the app, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

You will be able to **Add** and **Retrieve** the number from the blockchain.

> Note: Make sure you are connected to the **Sepolia Test Network** on Metamask.
