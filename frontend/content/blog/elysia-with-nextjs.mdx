<TableContent title="ElysiaJS with Next.JS and React Query" />

Elysia 1.0 version has released which is first stable release. And It's all set up for writing type safe Rest API for production. I like Elysia and reason is whether you want end to end type safe or performance(21x faster than [Express](https://expressjs.com/)) or built on intuitive API or good support of built in plugins which makes writing code fast and shipt fast.

I have already a blog written on **Elysia with Bun**, You can check it if you are building on BUN.

Elysia with Next.JS, I found interesting as we want our API to be end to end type safe and same time good developer experience. Since RSC(React Server Component) come to Next.JS, It has already simplified so many things which we can discuss later in other article. but writing API with next.js approach i still don't like but Writing API using elysia and then using in fronted Elysia provided [EDEN](https://elysiajs.com/eden/overview.html) makes life so much easier.

<SubHeadings>What is Eden?</SubHeadings>

Eden is a RPC connecter which provide end to end type safety without any code generation. It's easy to use and help to caught error on runtime as if we change our API structure in backend will reflect in frontend at same time with the help of Typescript inference.

## Elysia Route setup in Next.JS

Before we move ahead we need to install few packages which will help us to make it work. we are using `@tanstack/react-query` for client component **Query** and **Mutation** which also help in type inference.

We can use eden in Server Component directly as we use other async functions and good thing is we will get response fully type safe.

> `@tanstack/react-query` is optional you can use simple `useEffect` to fetch data or any other library. we are using latest 14.1.4 version with APP router.

```bash
yarn add elysia @elysiajs/eden @tanstack/react-query @elysiajs/bearer
```

Setting up route for all our API using elysia is so easy and straight forward, We just need to give a way to elysia that it can handle all our request.

We have to create a root entry point for all our api request to achieve this you can create a folder `app/api/[[...route]]/route.ts`.

```ts
// app/api/[[...route]]/route.ts

import { Elysia, t } from 'elysia';

const app = new Elysia({ prefix: '/api' }).get(
  '/hello',
  () => 'Hello from Elysia'
);

export type App = typeof app;

export const GET = app.handle;
export const POST = app.handle;
export const PUT = app.handle;
export const DELETE = app.handle;
```

This is all we need to setup elysia to Next.JS. Now we are all set to adding routes as per our need in easy way.

As you can see we are exporting `App` which holds all the type of our `app`. This `App` will help eden to infer type when we will use it in frontend.

## Elysia Eden setup in Server Component

Eden setup is too easy since Elysia doing all heavy lifting under the hood and giving us API which is easy to use.

```tsx
// app/page.tsx

import { treaty } from '@elysiajs/eden';
import { App } from './api/[[...route]]/route';

export const client = treaty<App>('localhost:3000');

const Page = async () => {
  const { data } = await client.api.hello.get();
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>{data}</h1>
    </main>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

Here we imported `treaty` from Elysia eden package and created a instance. We passed our backend running URL and `App` which we got from our backend API which help elysia in type inference.

As you can see now after instance is setup you can export `client` as use anywhere in you app. That `client` holds all the info with full type inference of our API.

Here we are using RSC(React Server Component) to fetch data directly in our component.

<Separator />

## Elysia Eden in Client Component

To use eden in client component we can use `useEffect` to fetch and mutation within function where we have to handle all the error state and loading state. Or we can use any third party library.

I found `@tanstack/react-query` as a standard for async state in React app. but it's up to you which one you wanna use. We have to create a provider and wrap our app with that to use React Query.

<Tabs items={["Provider", "App Wrap"]}>

    <Section slot="Provider" >
    ```tsx
    // lib/react-query.tsx

    'use client';

    import React, { ReactNode } from 'react';
    import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';

    const ReactQueryProvider = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => {
      const [queryClient] = React.useState(() => new QueryClient());

      return (
        <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>{children}</QueryClientProvider>
      );
    };

    export default ReactQueryProvider;
    ```

  </Section>

    <Section slot="Layout Wrap" >
    ```tsx
    // app/layout.tsx

    import ReactQueryProvider from '@/lib/react-query';

    export default function RootLayout({
      children,
    }: Readonly<{
      children: React.ReactNode;
    }>) {
      return (
        <html lang="en">
          <body>
            <ReactQueryProvider>{children}</ReactQueryProvider>
          </body>
        </html>
      );
    }
    ```

  </Section>

</Tabs>

Here we just created Provider and wrapped our `layout.tsx` file with the **ReactQueryProvider** component. which will make React Query context available globally in our app.

### Eden Query and Mutation in Client Component

We can use `useQuery` and `useMutation` hook which provided by React query which makes things easier and infer type so we will get our response which was returned by elysia eden is type safe.

<Tabs items={['Client Query', 'Post API', 'Client Mutation']}>

    <Section slot="Client Query">
    ```tsx
    // client.tsx
    "use client";

    import {  useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";
    import { client } from "../page";

    const Client = () => {
      const { data: index, isLoading } = useQuery({
        queryKey: ["index"],
        queryFn: () => client.api.index.get(),
      });

      return (
        <main>
          <h1>Client Component</h1>
          <p> {isLoading ? "Loading..." : index?.data}</p>
        </main>
      );
    };

    export default Client;
    ```

  </Section>

    <Section slot="Post API" >
    ```ts
    // server.ts
    import { Elysia, t } from "elysia";

    const app = new Elysia({ prefix: "/api" })
      .post(
        "/sign",
        ({ body }) => {
          return body;
        },
        {
          body: t.Object({
            name: t.String(),
            password: t.String(),
          }),
        }
      );

    export type App = typeof app;

    export const GET = app.handle;
    export const POST = app.handle;
    export const PUT = app.handle;
    export const DELETE = app.handle;
    ```

  </Section>

    <Section slot="Client Mutation" >
    ```tsx
    // client.tsx
    "use client";

    import { useMutation } from "@tanstack/react-query";
    import { client } from "../page";
    import { FormEvent } from "react";

    type SignUp = {
      name: string;
      password: string;
    };

    const Client = () => {
      const signUp = async (userData: SignUp) => {
        try {
          const { data, error } = await client.api.sign.post(userData);
          if (error) throw error;
          return data;
        } catch (error) {
          throw error;
        }
      };

      const { mutate, isPending } = useMutation({
        mutationFn: signUp,
        onError: (error) => {
          alert(error.message);
        },
        onSuccess: (data) => {
          alert(`You have signed up as ${data.name} with password ${data.password}`)
        },
      });

      const handleSignUp = async (e: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
        e.preventDefault();

        const formData = new FormData(e.currentTarget);
        const userData = Object.fromEntries(formData) as SignUp;

        const { name, password } = userData;
        if (password.trim() === "" || name.trim() === "")
          return alert("Fields are required");
        mutate(userData);
      };

      return (
        <main>
          <form onSubmit={handleSignUp}>
            <input type="text" name="name" />
            <input type="password" name="password" />
            <button type="submit" >
              {isPending ? "Loading..." : "Sign Up"}
            </button>
          </form>
        </main>
      );
    };

    export default Client;

    ```

  </Section>  
</Tabs>

As you can see above for query data it's as simple where we are just passing our function to **queryFn** and in return we get all the state in `queryData` which is type safe. React Query will handle all the state for us including **loading**, **error** and **success**. Which we can get in `isLoading`, `error` and `data`.

We also added a **Post Routee** where we are passing data to our API and getting data back. As we are passing data in **Body** so we are creating schema builder using `t` and valiadating data.

For client mutation we are using `useMutation` hook which is provided by React Query. We are passing our function to `mutationFn` and handling all the state in `onError` and `onSuccess` callback. The response we will get in `onError` and `onSuccess` will be type safe.

## Authentication of API

When It's come to make your API secure there are many way we can do that. But in this article we will use `Bearer Token` way to authenticate our API. Elysia provided a plugin which is `@elysiajs/bearer` which help us to read `Authorization` header and provide us the token which we can use to authenticate our API.

Let's for example we wanna secure our `/sign` API which we created above. We can use `@elysiajs/bearer` plugin and `onBeforeHandle` to check if token is valid or not before request go to our API.

<Tabs items={["Server API", "Client Mutation"]} >

    <Section slot="Server API" >
    ```ts

    // server.ts
    import bearer from "@elysiajs/bearer";
    import { Elysia, t } from "elysia";

    const app = new Elysia({ prefix: "/api" })
      .use(bearer())
      .onBeforeHandle(async ({ bearer, set }) => {
        if (!bearer) return (set.status = "Unauthorized");
        const isAuthorized = bearer === "12345678";
        if (!isAuthorized) {
          return (set.status = "Unauthorized");
        }
      })
      .post(
        "/sign",
        ({ bearer, body }) => {
          return body;
        },
        {
          body: t.Object({
            name: t.String(),
            password: t.String(),
          }),
        }
      );
       ```

</Section>

    <Section slot="Client Mutation" >
    ```tsx
      const signUp = async (userData: SignUp) => {
        try {
          const { data, error } = await client.api.sign.post(userData, {
            headers: {
              Authorization: "Bearer 12345678",
            },
          });
          if (error) throw error;
          return data;
        } catch (error) {
          throw error;
        }
      };
    ```

 </Section>

</Tabs>

As you can see above we are using `bearer` plugin and `onBeforeHandle` to check if token is valid or not. If token is not valid we are returning `Unauthorized` status. And in client mutation we are passing token in header which will be read by `@elysiajs/bearer` plugin and check if token is valid or not.

> In our Post Route any route after `use(bearer())` will be secure and need token to access. If you want to keep some route public you can keep it before `use(bearer())`.

## Conclusion

Elysia with Next.JS is a great combination to build type safe API and frontend. Eden is a great tool which help us to make our API type safe and easy to use. For client component, We can use React Query to handle all the state and make our app more robust and easy to maintain.
