<TableContent title="Nested Comments in React using Recursion" />

Comments are a common feature in many applications. Nested comments are a more advanced feature that allows users to reply to comments. You might have seen nested comments on platforms like Reddit, Facebook, or Twitter.

It is a good practice to use recursion to create nested comments. Basically, we will create a component that renders a comment and then calls itself to render the replies to that comment. This way, we can create a tree-like structure of comments.

Before we start, We need to understand what will be structure of comment object. A comment object will have two properties:

- `content`: The content of the comment.
- `children`: An array of child comments.

> You can also add more properties like `user`, `date`, etc. to the comment object as per your requirements.

**Content** property is string and **children** property is an array of comments. This is a recursive structure where each comment can have its own children comments.

## Creating a Comment Component

First we need to create a `Comment` component which will will be parent component for all comments. We can fetch all the comments and store in a state variable.

```tsx
// comment.tsx

import { useState } from 'react';
import CommentInput from './comment-form';
import CommentsItem from './commnet-items';

export type Comment = {
  content: string;
  children: Comment[];
};

const CommentComp = () => {
  const [comments, setComments] = useState<Comment[]>([]);

  const handleAddComment = (comment: Comment) => {
    setComments((prevComments) => [...prevComments, comment]);
  };

  return (
    <main>
      <div>
        <CommentInput handleAddComment={handleAddComment} />

        <div>
          {comments.map((comment, index) => (
            <CommentsItem
              key={index}
              comment={comment}
              onUpdateComments={(updatedComments) => {
                const updatedCommentsArray = [...comments];
                updatedCommentsArray[index].children = updatedComments;
                setComments(updatedCommentsArray);
              }}
            />
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </main>
  );
};

export default CommentComp;
```

In the above code, we have created a `CommentComp` component that renders a list of comments. We have used the `useState` hook to store the comments in a state variable. We have also created a `handleAddComment` function that adds a new comment to the list of comments.

`onUpdateComments` function is passed to the `CommentsItem` component as a prop. This function is used to update the comments array when a reply is added to a comment. Here we are updating the comments array by replacing the children of the comment with the updated children once a reply is added. We are using the index of the comment to update the correct comment in the array.

## Creating a Comment-Item Component

Next, we need to create a `CommentItem` component that will render a single comment. This component will also call itself recursively to render the replies to that comment.

```tsx
// comment-item.tsx

import { useState } from 'react';
import { Comment } from './comment';
import CommentInput from './comment-form';

const CommentsItem = ({
  comment,
  onUpdateComments,
}: {
  comment: Comment;
  onUpdateComments: (updatedComments: Comment[]) => void;
}) => {
  const [reply, setReply] = useState(false);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{comment.content}</p>
      <div>
        {reply && (
          <CommentInput
            handleAddComment={(e) => onUpdateComments([...comment.children, e])}
          />
        )}
        <button onClick={() => setReply(!reply)}>
          {reply ? 'Cancel' : 'Reply'}
        </button>
      </div>
      <div>
        {comment.children.map((child, index) => (
          <CommentsItem
            key={index}
            comment={child}
            onUpdateComments={(updatedComments) => {
              const updatedChildren = [...comment.children];
              updatedChildren[index] = { ...child, children: updatedComments };
              onUpdateComments(updatedChildren);
            }}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CommentsItem;
```

In the above code, we have created a `CommentsItem` component that renders a single comment. The component takes two props: `comment` and `onUpdateComments`. The `comment` prop contains the comment to be rendered, and the `onUpdateComments` prop is a function that is called when a reply is added to the comment.

The component renders the content of the comment and a button to reply to the comment. When the reply button is clicked, the `CommentInput` component is rendered to allow the user to add a reply. The `reply` state variable is used to toggle the visibility of the `CommentInput` component.

The component then renders the replies to the comment using the `comment.children` array. For each child comment, the `CommentsItem` component is called **recursively** to render the child comment.

## Creating a CommentForm Component

Finally, we need to create a `CommentForm` component that allows the user to add a new comment. We are reusing the `CommentForm` component in the `CommentItem` and `CommentComp` components.

```tsx
import { FormEvent } from 'react';
import { Comment } from '../utils/util';

const CommentInput = ({
  handleAddComment,
}: {
  handleAddComment: (comment: Comment) => void;
}) => {
  const handleSubmit = (e: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const formData = new FormData(e.currentTarget as HTMLFormElement);
    const comment = formData.get('comment') as string;
    if (!comment || comment.trim() === '') return alert('Comment is required');

    handleAddComment({ content: comment, children: [] });
    e.currentTarget.reset();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input type="text" name="comment" placeholder="Add comment" />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CommentInput;
```

In the above code, we have created a `CommentInput` component that renders a form with an input field to add a new comment. The component takes a `handleAddComment` prop, which is a function that is called when the form is submitted. The `handleAddComment` function adds the new comment to the list of comments.

We have added some basic validation to check if the comment is empty before adding it to the list of comments. once comment is added, we are resetting the form.

### Conclusion

Recursion is a powerful technique that can be used to create nested comments in React. By creating a component that calls itself recursively, we can create a tree-like structure of comments. This allows users to reply to comments and create nested threads of conversation.
